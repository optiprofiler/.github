### 🎯 Our Mission

The **OptiProfiler** organization is dedicated to providing reliable, reproducible, and easy-to-use tools for benchmarking numerical optimization algorithms. We bridge the gap between algorithm development and performance analysis by offering a standardized benchmarking environment across different programming languages and systems.

---

### 🚀 Core Repository

The heart of our ecosystem is the **OptiProfiler** package, available for both **MATLAB** and **Python**.

*   [**optiprofiler**](https://github.com/optiprofiler/optiprofiler): The main benchmarking framework. It allows users to run solvers on large sets of problems, apply various "features" (noise, rotations, quantization), and automatically generate professional performance, data, and log-ratio profiles. Offical website: [optprof.com](https://optprof.com)

### 📚 Problem Libraries

We provide interfaces to various problem libraries, allowing `optiprofiler` to access a diverse range of test problems, primarily focusing on the variants of the classic CUTEst collections.
